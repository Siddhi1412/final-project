        <h2>What is Health?</h2>
      <h4> The meaning of ‘health’ can be individually viewed from various perspectives.  Understanding how different individuals consider health on a personal level could provide professionals with useful indications on what can influence behaviour with respect to health and wellness within the general population

		“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”

        This means that health is a resource to support an individual’s function in wider society, rather than an end in itself. A healthful lifestyle provides the means to lead a full life with meaning and purpose.

		<h2>What are the types of Health?</h2>
	<h4>   Mental and physical health are probably the two most frequently discussed types of health.

        Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical well-being.

        People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health.

        <h4>   According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,Trusted Source mental health refers to a person’s emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Mental health is as important as physical health as part of a full, active lifestyle.

            2) bounce back after difficult experiences and adapt to adversity
            3) balance different elements of life, such as family and finances,etc
