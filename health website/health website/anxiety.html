        <h2>What is Anxiety Disorder?</h2>
       <h3> Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future.
		Anxiety is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat. It can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations."For me, anxiety feels as if everyone in the world is waiting for me to trip up, so
		that they can laugh at me. It makes me feel nervous and unsure whether the next step I take is the best way forward."
		Most people feel anxious at times. It's particularly common to experience some anxiety while coping with stressful events or changes, especially if they could have a big impact
		on your life.

		<h2>What are Anxiety disorder?</h2>
        <h3>
			Anxiety can be experienced in lots of different ways. If your experiences meet certain criteria your doctor might diagnose you with a specific anxiety disorder.
			Some commonly diagnosed anxiety disorders are:
			<ul>
			<li>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) – this means having regular or uncontrollable worries about many different things in your everyday life. Because there are lots of possible symptoms of anxiety this can be quite a broad diagnosis, meaning that
			the problems you experience with GAD might be quite different from another person's experiences.</li> <br>
			<li> Social anxiety disorder – this diagnosis means you experience extreme fear or anxiety triggered by social situations (such as parties, workplaces, or everyday
			situations where you have to talk to another person). It is also known as social phobia. See our section on types of phobia for more information.</li> <br>
			<li>Panic disorder – this means having regular or frequent panic attacks without a clear cause or trigger. Experiencing panic disorder can mean that you feel
			constantly afraid of having another panic attack, to the point that this fear itself can trigger your panic attacks. See our section on panic attacks for more information.</li> <br>
			<li> Phobias – a phobia is an extreme fear or anxiety triggered by a particular situation (such as going outside) or a particular object (such as spiders). See our resource on phobias for more information.</li> <br>
			<li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – this is a diagnosis you may be given if you develop anxiety problems after going through something you found traumatic.</li> <br>
			<li>Health anxiety – this means you experience obsessions and compulsions relating to illness, including researching symptoms or checking to see if you have them. </li><br>
			<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – you may be given this diagnosis if your anxiety problems involve having repetitive thoughts, behaviours or urges.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What causes Anxiety</h2>
		<h3>
			Anxiety may be caused by a mental condition, a physical condition, the effects of drugs, stressful life events, or a combination of these. The doctor's initial task is to see if your anxiety is a symptom of another medical condition. Anxiety disorders are different from normal anxiety.
			Everyone's experience of anxiety is different, so it's hard to know exactly what causes anxiety problems. There are probably lots of factors involved.
